      <h4>Getting more women into open source, one Summer at a time</h4>
      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is a global scholarship helping Rails Girls students (and students from other, comparable initiatives) get into Open Source. By providing this stipend, we enable students to dedicate themselves to their Open Source learning projects full-time. </p>
      <h4>More diversity in Open Source means a better industry for everyone</h4>
      <p>The program sees a huge amount of publicity from our student teams, coaches and organisers: be it on Twitter, Facebook, blogs or at conferences and local developers meet ups. It’s a great blend of marketing, and genuinely contributing to the development community.</p>

      <h3>Mention &amp; display of your logo at conferences</h3>
      <p>Students are encourage and supported to give full talks or lightning talks at conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) as well as local programming and tech meetups. Students are presenting their projects at these meetups, and how Summer of Code is helping them do it. Some organizers also present about the Summer of Code program as a whole. The articele "<a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/Summer_of/">Summer of Conferences</a>" about last year's events will give you an impression on what we're up to.</p>
      <p>All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code are supposed to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors’ logos at the beginning of their presentation.</p>
