###Travis
Travis is an open source company, born and raised in beautiful Berlin. Travis CI is their hosted continuous integration service for the open source community. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for a ton of programming languages, like Python, Go, PHP, Java, C++ and of course Ruby. Hosting your project on travis-ci.org means you can effortlessly test your library or applications against multiple runtimes and data stores without even having all of them installed locally!
