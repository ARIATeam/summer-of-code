      <h3 id="12">I'm sponsoring Rails Girls Summer of Code. What about VAT and tax deduction for my donations?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>We don't really know about tax laws everywhere in the world but according to our tax advisor: "Contributions and payments to Rails Girls Summer of Code are not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes. However, they may be deductible under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for US) or your local tax authority's advice."</p>
        <p>A word about VAT. Sorry to bother you - we'll keep a long story short. If you're not from Europe (to be precise - from the EU) you can skip this. For all the others: we have to struggle with the odd EU VAT regulations for the above mentioned packages. During you fill out the form and entered an EU country we will show a field to ask for your VAT ID. If you have one please enter it - otherwise your contribution will be reduced by 19% VAT. You come from Germany? We will show you a field to ask if VAT is a recoverable tax for you. If so, we will add the 19% VAT to your contribution and ask you to complete your address data.</p>

      <h3 id="13">What happens if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
      <div>
        Summer of Code will offer a reduced amount of spots to students. We currently account for raising
        $5000 per student. So if we raise $30,000 we have enough money to fund 6 students.
      </div>
      <h3 id="14">What happens to my donations if Summer of Code does not go ahead?</h3>
      <div>
        If for some reason the Summer of Code can't go ahead as planned, donors will be offered a refund of
        their donation. Alternatively you can decide to have your donation go to the Rails Girls
        organization to share your donation with other, future Rails Girls events across the globe.
      </div>
      <h3 id="15">What happens with any left-over money from the 2013 Summer of Code?</h3>
      <div>
        Any money left over from the campaign will be saved for next year's Rails Girls Summer of Code.
        Should there be no Summer of Code in 2014, the Rails Girls organization will decide how to best
        spend any left over donation money.
