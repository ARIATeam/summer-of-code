<h1>Coaching Company Guide</h1>

Do you have free space for at least a one to two-person team to work? Do have
developers passionate about helping newcomers, and working on Open Source?

You might just have what it takes to be a coaching company.

When Summer of Code students undertake their scholarship for the summer, they
need a place to work. While working from home is an option for some
participants, having the exposure to a productive work environment and ready
access to coaches, can really mean the difference between a life changing, or
stressful Summer of Code experience.

Hereâ€™s where you (and your company) come in. Being a coaching company is not
only super rewarding for your developers and team, it is also a great way to
show your support for the Open Source communtiy and local dev structures.

<h2 id="q1">Why Should I Be A Coaching Company?</h2>

There are tonnes of good reasons to be a coaching company; altrusitic
fulfillment, the good of the development community, a more diverse Open Source
contributor network, and much more. However, one of the best parts of being a
Coaching Company is the huge amount of organic publicity your company garners.

Here are some selected blog posts from 2013 to help illustrate what it means to
support a team:

Coaching Companies get a lot of love from the community. Tweets, blog posts,
personal recommendations from participants, and mentions at conferences. The
reach of where you can take your support is really only limited by your
imagination.

Being a Coaching Company has a very direct affect on the lives and projects of
participants, and makes your company an extremely attractive one to potential
hires, conference organisers, tech bloggers, journalists and media outlets.


<h2 id="q2">What makes a Good Coaching Company?</h2>

Any company with a respectful, inclusive culture, good internet, and a team of
developers could make a good coaching company. That really is it. Great
examples for Coaching Companies from 2013 include SoundCloud, Absolventa, and
Travis CI.

Some coaching companies have supported participants who already work for their
company. Companies who want to host a team of their own employees should make
sure they state this in their application, so we know you have a specific team
you would like to support.

You might choose to come up with a plan for when participants work with you, or
may have them come and go like normal employees in a work day. You could even
be a co-working space who wants to host a team, and has gathered a roster of
coaches to help.

There is no one size fits all coaching company, but the one thing they all have
in common is the inherent value they see in supporting a team in and of itself.

We expect coaching companies to host teams in a safe and productive work
environment.


<h2 id="q3">What Does A Coaching Company Do?</h2>

In essence, you give away a piece of space in your office for your team to work
in, and make sure that team have access to developers to coach them. All of the
extras are up to you. You might want your team to present their work at weekly
team meetings, so you can stay up-to-date on their progress, or support them to
attend conferences and meetups.


<h2 id="q4">What Coaching Companies Don't Do</h2>

* Coaching companies do not provide financial assistance to teams, nor should
  they use remuneration as an incentive to attract a team.
* Coaching companies don't get teams to work on their own non-Open Source
  product.
* Coaching companies can't demand their teams be chosen.

Teams who don't get a sponsored seat, but still want to participate and work on
their projectcalled volunteer teams.

So what if you don't have a team you want to support? If you want to offer your
company to potential participants, drop us a line, or register your company by
emailing us: <a
href="mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a>.
