          <h2>Are you interested in becoming a Coaching Company?</h2>
                <div>
                 
                  <p>Do you have free space for at least a one to two-person team to work from? Do you have developers passionate about helping newcomers, and working on open source? Do you have a group of newcomers to code, who want to participate in Summer of Code?</p>
                  <p>You might just have what it takes to be a coaching company. Send us an email to get started <a href="mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a></p>

                  <p>When Summer of Coders undertake their scholarship for the summer, they could be sacrificing a full-time job, and thus their normal work environment. While working from home is an option for participants, having the exposure to a productive work environment and ready access to coaches, can really mean the difference between a life changing, or stressful SoC experience.</p>
                  <p>Here’s where you (and your company) come in. Perhaps you don’t have the budget to spare for a sponsor package, BUT you have the space and resources. Perhaps you have the capacity for both. Being a coaching company is not only super rewarding for you developers, and team, it is also a great way to show how you are supporting Open Source contributors.</p>

                  <h3>Why Should I Be A Coaching Company?</h3>

                  There are tonnes of good reasons to be a coaching company; altrusitic fulfillment, the good of the development community, a more diverse Open Source contributor network, and much more. However, one of the best parts of being a Coaching Company is the huge amount of organic publicity your company garners.

                  <p>Coaching Companies get a lot of love from the community. Tweets, blog posts (both <a href="http://railsgrrls.tumblr.com/">externally</a> and <a href=”http://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/07/19/rails-girls-summer-of-code-welcoming-nicole-and-laura/”>on their own blogs</a>), personal recommendations from participants, and mentions at conferences. The reach of where you can take your SoC support is really only limited by your imagination.</p>

                  <p>Being a Coaching Company has a very direct affect on the lives and projects of participants, and makes your company an extremely attractive one to potential hires, conference organisers, tech bloggers, journalists and media outlets.</p>

                  <h3>Who Makes a Good Coaching Company</h3>

                  <p>Any company with a respectful, inclusive culture, good internet, and a team of developers could make a good coaching company. That really is it. We feature SoundCloud heavily, because they were such a great example, but other amazing coaching companies from 2013 include __, __, and __.</p>

                  <p>Some coaching companies have supported participants who already work for their company. Companies who want to host a team of their own employees should make sure they state this in their application, so we know you have a specific team you would like to support.</p>

                  <p>You might choose to come up with a plan for when participants work with you, or may have them come and go like normal employees in a work day. You could even be a co-working space who wants to host a team, and has gathered a roster of coaches to help.</p>

                  <p>There is no one size fits all coaching company, but the one thing they all have in common is the inherent value they see in supporting a team in and of itself.</p>

                  <p>We expect coaching companies to host teams in a safe and productive work environment.</p>

                  <h3>What Does A Coaching Company Do?</h3>
                  
                  <p>In essence, you give away a piece of space in your office for your team to work in, and make sure that team have access to developers to coach them. All of the extras are up to you. You might want your team to present their work at weekly team meetings, so you can stay up-to-date on their progress, or support them to attend conferences and meetups.</p>

                 <p>What coaching companies DON’T DO</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Coaching companies are NOT obliged to provide financial assistance to teams, NOR should they use remuneration as an incentive to attract a team.</li>
                     <li>Coaching companies DON’T get teams to work on their own product.</li>
                     <li>Coaching companies DON’T demand their teams be chosen.</li>
                  </ul>


                  <p>If the team you are supporting has a paid seat in the Rails Girls Summer of Code, you shouldn’t pay them.</p> 
                  <p>We don’t want to put other paid participants at a financial disadvantage, so if you decide you would like to pay your supported team, they cannot have a paid Rails Girls Summer of Code seat.</p> 
                  <p>These teams are called volunteer teams; they may not be accepted into the program but still want to complete their project. In this case we fully support them receiving remuneration, AS LONG AS they still work full time on their projects for the summer. This was the case with Team __ who were not successful in gaining a paid seat with SoC. Absolventa were their coaching company, and paid them a small stipend to ensure they could work on their project.</p>
                  <p>So what if you don’t have a team you want to support? If you want to offer your company to potential participants, drop us a line, or register your company here.</p>

                  <h3>Where are Coaching Companies Located?</h3>

                  <p>Planet earth.</p>

                  <p>The Rails Girls Summer of Code organisation committee is in Berlin, but our participants work on their projects all over the world.</p> 

                  <p>While a lot of coaching companies in 2013 were Berlin-based, we highly encourage companies from all over the world to get involved. We are aiming at having participants from a greater variety of countries in 2014, so regardless of your coordinates on planet earth, there is probably a team that could do with your support.</p>

                  <p>We’re very sorry if your company is based on another planet in the solar system, but we have to insist that your physical office space is attached to this planet of earth.</p>

                  <h3>How Long Does Summer of Code Last</h3>

                  <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code starts in July, and ends September 2014. That means it won't be summer EVERYWHERE in the world. You will host your team from the start of their project to the end of the 3 month period.</p>
