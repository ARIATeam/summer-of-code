            <p>So what is Rails Girls Summer of Code all about?</p>

            <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is a global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source. Successful applicants are paid a monthly stipend, from July-September, to work on Open Source projects of their choice.</p>
            <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping newcomers to the world of programming further expand their knowledge and skills, by contributing to a worthwhile Open Source project. The focus is not on producing highly sophisticated code, but rather participants learning highly transferable skills from their project work.</p>
